The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses.
It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.

This kind of functionality was previously achieved using XMLHttpRequest. Fetch provides a better alternative that can be easily 
used by other technologies such as Service Workers. Fetch also provides a single logical place to define other HTTP-related concepts 
such as CORS and extensions to HTTP.

JavaScript | Callbacks

Callbacks are a great way to handle something after something else has been completed. By something here we mean a function execution.
If we want to execute a function right after the return of some other function,then callbacks can be used.
